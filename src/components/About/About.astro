                                        Photographing weddings for me is about creating a calm space where you can be fully
                                        present. I blend gentle direction with documentary coverage so you never feel staged, yet
                                        every meaningful detail is preserved.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Before the celebration we will craft a timeline together, scout the light, and plan for
                                        any special traditions or family dynamics. On the day-of I stay attentive, supportive, and
                                        ready for the fleeting moments that say the most.
                                </p>

                                        When you receive your gallery, it arrives thoughtfully edited, organized, and designed
                                        for how you want to relive the memories—whether that is through wall art, albums, or a
                                        digital story to share with loved ones.
                                </p>
